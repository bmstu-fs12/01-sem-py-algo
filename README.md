1 Semester Python and Algorithms and Data Structures Course

## Goals

The main goal of this course is to show first-year FS12 students how to write clean, easy-to-read and easy-to-support code with complete understanding of its algorithmic complexity. During this course students will learn following topics:

- basics of Python;
- concepts of asymptotic complexity, algorithms and data structures;
- numerous algorithmic areas: sorting algorithms, hashes & hash-maps, trees;
- basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP);
- SQL essentials;
- basics of asynchronous and parallel programming;
- usage of GIT & Github;
- small future career tips.

## Requirements

To complete course students have to **pass 3 tests** and do some **coding hometasks**.

It is highly recommended to have **your own computer** (laptop is better) to complete this course, because you will have to write some code as a homework.
It is worth to use **Unix-like Operating System** (Linux, BSD, MacOS) during this course, because some actions are much easier with it. Window Subsystem for Linux is Okay, but we do not really recommend it.

**Teamwork is appreciated** during this course, but **not cheating**.

## Plan

Course consists of 34 standard classes (one class - 1.5 hour): 2 classes per week. Most time you will have 2 consecutive classes in one day each week.

Each week includes two video lectures in russian language and two presentations, worth-to-read links and homework tasks.
